<h3><b>About Me</b></h3>

<br>

I am Shashree aka TheCoderGuru and I enjoy coding, reading web development references, following UX design trends and when I am not coding you can find me designing a website.

In addition, I am active on Frontend Mentor completing challenges to better my frontend development skills in addition to giving feedback to other developers. You may find me active in the Frontend Mentor community sometimes or on Slack. üñ•

    <summary>Read my story</summary>

    My interest in coding started last two years when I was intrigued with how websites were created and also when I discovered that tutorials existed for web development. This led to me following along with various tutorials when I had no idea about HTML or CSS or how they came together to form a website.

    The journey from that point onwards has been filled with good times and bad times since I have experienced moments where I was clueless about achieving particular designs however I found some solace in using a handy-dandy invention within your browser called the Developer Tools.

    Currently, I follow youtube creators like Kevin Powell, Gary Simon and Traversy Media and this has greatly empowered me to keep coding and being persistent in order to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have learnt that coding is not about what you know but what you can figure out and this has greatly inspired me to keep learning but more importantly is to have fun while learning, it should not be tiresome but as an individual you should feel motivated to code and just learn more. The takeaway is to not give up when you encounter an error or problem when coding, rather you should firstly retrace your steps in your coding process and try to find the error, if that does not work then google the error and try to find credible support channels that might give a solution to your problem.

    I am in the process of learning the core concepts of Javascript in order to code user-friendly accessible websites that not only capture your eye visually but also accessibly.

    I truly believe that no matter what part of the world you are located in, website development unites everyone together under one common goal and despite our differences if we see each other as different we become less different.
